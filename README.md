# Variable-Shadowing---Scipy.Signal-Module
Variable Shadowing Toy Ex.: 'scipy.signal' Module

Main Toy Use-Case:
Variable Shadowing: scipy signal module vs. reusing main variable name 'signal' Ex: Bool or Enum Case Flag Control System.

Use-Case Target Demo.: Helps you avoid renaming highly likely reusable variable name default behavior as ex. signal vars name and cautiously while using scipy.signal module import for tracking confusing signal vars. naming vs. module imports (easy handling applied to all use case module libraries imports where this variable shadowing error is most likely to occur)!

With simple appl. of a-renaming or lambda, we can create interesting combos. of conditional options for multiple imports... Exactly where these errors reside  by defaulting our own user pref. behavior is most likely to clash with our own internal vars name (local vs. module outside scoping) symbology mapping.
